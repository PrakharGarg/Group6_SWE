Season with salt and pepper and set aside.For the Asian chicken burger: Combine the chicken, hoisin, sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic and scallions in a large bowl. Mix together and form into 4 equal patties about 1/2-inch thick and 4 inches wide. This patty will be a bit wetter than your average patty because of the sauces and flavor in there. Sprinkle each side of the patties generously with salt and pepper. Create a small well in the center of each patty, using your thumb.Cook your patties on the griddle over medium heat until golden brown on each side and 160 degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Because of the sugar content in these patties, they can burn easily so watch your heat. Let rest 5 minutes. Place your buns on the griddle and toast them.For assembling: Place some of the spicy lemongrass mayo on each side of the buns. Add the chicken patties and top with the Pickled Asian Slaw. Finish with the top bun and serve with additional slaw and mayo on the side.                                                Pickled Asian Slaw:                                        Add the rice wine vinegar to a mixing bowl and whisk in the sesame oil and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Add the ginger, cabbage and peppers and toss to coat with the dressing. Adjust the seasoning and let sit 20 minutes to let the flavors meld together before serving.

Remove from the heat and fold in the pistachios. Let cool.In a bowl fitted with an electric mixer, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Whisk about 1/3 of the cream into the cooled chocolate, then gently fold in the remaining whipped cream. Pour the chocolate mixture into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and chill it overnight. Unwrap the terrine, invert onto a serving platter, and shake gently to release. Remove the plastic wrap from the top and let sit at room temperature about 15 minutes to soften. Slice into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch slices and serve with the Orange Creme Anglaise on the side, and garnish with the candied almond slivers.                                                Orange Creme Anglaise:                                        In a medium saucepan, bring the half-and-half, vanilla bean and vanilla seeds, and orange zest to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat and discard the vanilla bean.In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until thick and ribbons form, about 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in about 3/4 cup of the hot half-and-half, and whisk until well incorporated. Add the egg mixture to the saucepan with the remaining half-and-half and cook, stirring, over medium heat, until it forms a thick custard, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain into a clean bowl set in an ice bath to chill quickly. Add the orange flavored liqueur and stir to combine.Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down on the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and refrigerate until cool, about 2 hours, or overnight. Yield: about 2 1/2 cups                                                Candied Almond Slivers:                                        Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the almonds and lightly toast, stirring. Add the sugar, and cook, stirring until the sugar melts and the almonds are evenly coated. Transfer to a foil-lined baking sheet, stirring to separate the nuts. Let cool.

When the mixer stops, the meringue should not move around in the bowl. Meanwhile cut up butter into 2-inch pieces. (The butter should be slightly moist on the outside but cold inside.)On your mixer, remove the whip and attach the paddle. Add half the butter into the bowl immediately and pulsate the mixer several times until the meringue has covered the butter completely. To pulsate the mixer, turn it on and off in a jerky motion. This forces the butter on the top to the bottom of the bowl. Add the balance of the butter and pulsate mixer several times. Slowly increase the mixer's speed, starting with the lowest speed and increase the speed every 10 seconds until you reach a medium high speed.Continue beating until the mixture begins to look light and fluffy. Stop the mixer and scrape the bowl. Reduce speed to LOW. Add vanilla and butterfinger, continue to beat on LOW speed for 45 seconds. Then beat on MEDIUM-HIGH speed for an additional 45 to 60 seconds.Leftover buttercream can be placed in plastic containers with lids and kept in the freezer for up to 3 months. Defrost completely (several hours) and rewhip before using.Storage: Store the icing in an airtight container and freeze for up to 3 months.",

  "instructions": "Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F and arrange the rack in the middle. Coat two 8-inch cake pans with butter and flour, and tap out any excess flour. Set aside.Combine flour, baking powder, cardamom, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger, and salt in a large bowl, and whisk to aerate and break up any lumps. Set aside.Combine eggs, sugar, oil, buttermilk, and vanilla in a large bowl, and whisk until eggs are broken up and mixture is thoroughly combined. Using a rubber spatula, fold in flour mixture until just combined. Fold in carrots and walnuts until evenly mixed.Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 to 60 minutes.Remove cakes from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool, about 15 minutes. Run a knife around the perimeter of each, and turn cakes out onto the rack to cool completely.To frost, place a cake layer on an 8-inch cardboard round, a tart-pan bottom, or a cake plate. Evenly spread about 1/3 of the frosting over the top of the layer. Stack the second layer, and evenly spread another 1/3 of the frosting over the top and sides of the whole cake. (Don\u2019t worry about looks at this point\u2014this is just a basecoat, a.k.a. a crumb layer, and it will be covered up later.) Place in the refrigerator until frosting is set up and slightly hard, about 15 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and spread remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake, ensuring it\u2019s as even as possible. Serve.Beverage pairing: Dow\u2019s 10 Years Old Tawny Porto, Portugal. Spiced desserts like carrot cake go wonderfully with sweet wines that have some degree of oxidation, such as tawny port, Madeira, and Vin Santo. The nutmeg, cardamon, and cinnamon just seem to fit smoothly with the nut and toffee notes of the wines. This Dow\u2019s port is a great tawny for carrot cake, as it\u2019s one of least sweet versions of this style.",

Grease 3 (8-inch) round cake pans and line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper. Spray the paper and pans with baking spray. Set the pans aside until ready to use.In the bowl of an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the oil and sugars together until combined. Mix in the vanilla and add the eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the carrots and pineapple and mix until combined.In a large bowl sift together the 2 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cardamom and cinnamon. With the mixer speed on low, add the flour mixture to the carrot mixture alternately with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour. Mix until just combined. In a small bowl, toss the pecans with the remaining 1 tablespoon of flour. Fold the pecans into the batter.Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 35 to 45 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on wire racks for 15 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and cool completely on the racks.While the cakes are cooling, prepare the icing. In the bowl of an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter and cream cheese together until well combined. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the confectioners' sugar. Mix until combined. Add the vanilla and white chocolate. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside 1 cup of icing for decoration. Add the heavy cream and beat until combined.To frost the cake, arrange 1 cake layer on a cake plate. Spread the top with the cream cheese icing and top with a second and third cake layer, spreading the icing between each layer. Spread the icing on top and around the sides of the cake. Apply the almonds to the sides of the frosted cake. Fill a pastry bag, fitted with a star tip, with the reserved icing and pipe a border around the top of the cake. Cut the cake and serve.A viewer, who may not be a professional cook, provided this recipe.

Set chicken aside wrapped in foil to keep them warm. Keep the pan of drippings from the chicken to start the Madeira sauce.3)On Medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add mushrooms and saut\u00e9 for a couple of minutes. Add Madeira wine, beef stock, butter and pepper and bring sauce to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes or until sauce has reduced to about 1/4 of the original volume. The sauce will thicken and turn a dark brown color when it is done. Depending on the temperature of your stove, this may take a little longer.4)In a medium saucepan, fill halfway with water and bring to a boil. Season water with salt and toss asparagus into the water and boil. Keep an eye on this step, you don't want to over cook your asparagus. Depending on the thickness of your spears, this could take up to 3 to 5 minutes. When finished, drop the asparagus in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. The asparagus should be slightly tender when done, not mushy.5)Set your oven to broil. Arrange the cooked chicken breast fillets on a baking pan and cross 2 asparagus spears over each fillet. Top with a slice of mozzarella cheese and broil for 3 to 4 minutes or until the cheese begins to slightly brown.6)Serve by arranging 2 chicken breast fillets on each plate and spoon 3 to 4 tablespoons of Madeira sauce over the chicken.",

Brush both sides of each piece of dough with olive oil. Spread one side of each piece of dough with pesto sauce.Once the grill is hot carefully transfer the pizza doughs (one at a time) to the grill. Grill for 2-3 minutes or until lightly charred. Flip and grill one minute longer. Immediately remove from the grill. Cut into triangles and serve with the hummus.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Lie your sliced tomatoes flat on the baking sheet and drizzle with 1-2 tablespoons olive oil. Generously sprinkle the tomatoes with salt and pepper. Now sprinkle with 1-2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the tomatoes are beginning to char and caramelize around the edges. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.Meanwhile add 1/4 cup olive oil, the smashed garlic and oregano to a small sauce pot. Warm over medium-low heat, being careful not to burn the garlic for 10 minutes or until hot. While the oil heats add the beans, tahini, tomato paste, mozzarella and 1-2 tablespoons parmesan to the bowl of a food processor. Add in 1/2 cup of the reserve liquid from the cans of beans (or 1/2 cup warm water). Puree the mixture until smooth, scrapping down the sides if necessary for about 5-8 minutes. Once the oil is hot, remove the garlic. Carefully and slowly pour the hot oil into the food processor, puree until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. The hot oil should melt the cheese. Stir in 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil.Now grab the roasted tomatoes. Finely chop them and add them to a bowl with 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil and the chopped pine nuts. Toss.Spoon the hummus into a serving bowl (use an oven-safe bowl if you plan on baking). Spoon the tomatoes over top the hummus. If desired you can stir the tomatoes into the hummus or serve them dolloped over top. Drizzle with olive oil if desired. Sprinkle with basil. Serve with the pizza bread.To bake the hummus, preheat the oven to 400 degreed F. Add anywhere from 4-8 ounces fresh mozzarella over top the hummus. Bake for 15 minutes, then add the tomatoes and place under the broiler for 2-3 minutes or until the cheese becomes bubbly and lightly browned. Serve hot with the pizza bread.",

The cookies will have started to crack a little and will look puffy. Remove the cookies from the oven. The cookies will continue to crackle just a little more and then \"deflate.\"Let the cookies cool for about 3 minutes on the cookie sheet and then remove to a wire rack to cool.Meanwhile, prepare the lemon cream cheese filling.Mix all the filling ingredients together, except for the powdered sugar, with an electric hand mixer until well combined. Gradually mix in the powdered sugar.Place the filling in the refrigerator until the cookies have completely cooled.To assemble the cookie sandwiches, place 1 teaspoon of lemon cream filling in the middle of each cookie and place another cookie on top. There should be just enough filling for a thin layer of icing. Place the cookie sandwiches in an airtight container and refrigerate for up for 1 week. Do not stack the cookies as they might stick together! If you need to stack them, separate each layer with a piece of plastic wrap, wax paper, etc.",

  "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350F, spray oven-safe skillet with cooking spray (mine is a Le Creuset enameled cast iron and I sprayed liberally with Pam for Baking and it released like a charm; if skillet is well-seasoned cast iron, you may wish to butter or grease it slightly; set skillet aside. Alternatively, cookie may be baked in a 9-by-9 inch square baking pan that has been lined with foil or sprayed with cooking spray; do not use a 9-inch circular pie dish because it will be too shallow. In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter, about 1 minute on high power (you may microwave butter to a browned-butter state, which makes this cookie especially delicious, by cooking butter for about 3 to 4 minutes; watch it closely so it doesn't burn. See browning butter in the microwave tips. To the melted butter, add sugar, egg, vanilla, and whisk or stir vigorously to combine, for about 1 minute, slightly fluffing up the batter. Add the flour, baking soda, salt, and stir until just incorporated. Add the oats and stir to combine. Pour slightly less than three-quarters of the dough into the skillet, reserving about 1 1/4 cups (just eyeball it) to be crumbled on at the end; set skillet and large mixing bowl with reserved dough aside. In a small bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk and peanut butter and stir until smooth. Pour mixture over the dough in the skillet. Evenly sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top. Drop tablespoon-sized chunks of the reserved dough into the skillet, dispersing then as uniformly as possible over the surface, which forms the crumble topping. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until edges begin to barely crisp up and most of the top surface of the cookie has set. The center may not be completely set; this is okay because cookie will continue to cook in the skillet after it's been pulled from the oven, noting that there is a fairly significant carryover cooking effect with cast iron; so don't overbake in the oven because cookie is meant to be very gooey. Cookie may be served immediately; optionally serve it with ice cream. Cookie is best eaten fresh from the oven but due to its size, extra cookie may be sliced and stored in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, reheating gently in the microwave before serving leftovers if desired.",

Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until bubbles form around the edges of the pan. Remove from the heat, and set aside.In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until just combined. Gradually add some of the hot cream mixture into beaten egg yolks, to temper. Whisk the egg mixture into the remaining hot cream mixture, stirring constantly. If lumps form, pour the mixture into a bowl through a fine wire-mesh strainer. Evenly divide the mixture into 6 to 8 flameproof ramekins. Arrange the ramekins in a 13 by 9-inch baking dish, and fill the dish with 1 1/2 inches hot water. Bake until the custard has set and is firm, about 30 to 45 minutes. Let cool on wire racks, then wrap in heavy-duty plastic wrap and chill at least 6 to 8 hours.Sprinkle each custard evenly with a little of the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Broil 5 1/2 inches from heat until sugar melts and becomes a caramel color. Remove the custards from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes to allow the sugar to harden. Sugar may also be browned with a professional culinary torch.

  "instructions": "For the cookies:Place the egg yolk and vanilla in a small bowl and stir to combine; set aside.Combine the measured flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a food processor fitted with a blade attachment and pulse a few times to aerate and break up any lumps. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like sand, about 25 (1-second) pulses. Add the reserved yolk mixture and pulse just until the dough forms into a ball, about 30 (1-second) pulses.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide it into 2 equal portions. Using your hands and flouring them as needed, roll each portion into a log about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap each log in plastic wrap and refrigerate until just firm but still pliable, about 1 hour. (The logs will flatten slightly while chilling. If you have a paper towel tube available, cut it in half lengthwise and nestle the cookie dough in there; this will help the dough keep its cylindrical shape while it chills.) Reshape the logs so they are perfectly round and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour more.Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F and arrange the racks to divide the oven into thirds. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.Remove a dough log from the refrigerator, remove the plastic wrap, and slice the dough into 1/8-inch coins. Place the cookies 1/2 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets (about 20 cookies per sheet).Place both sheets in the oven and bake for 9 minutes. Rotate the sheets front to back and top to bottom and continue baking until the edges of the cookies are firm but the tops are still soft, about 7 to 8 minutes more.Place the baking sheets on wire racks and let cool for 5 minutes. Using a flat spatula, transfer the cookies to the wire racks to cool completely. Let the baking sheets cool completely and repeat with the remaining dough (you can reuse the parchments).For the filling:Place the mint candies in a resealable plastic bag. Using a meat mallet, crush them into tiny pieces, but don\u2019t totally pulverize them into a powder. (Alternatively, you can use a frying pan to crush the candies.) You should have about 1/3 cup; set aside.Combine the powdered sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low speed until crumbly, about 2 minutes. Gradually increase the speed to medium and beat until smooth, about 2 minutes more. Add the vanilla and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer and scrape down the paddle and the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.Increase the speed to high, add the crushed candies, and beat until just combined, about 10 seconds. Place the filling in a large resealable plastic bag, push to one bottom corner, and cut a 1/2-inch opening in that corner.Flip half of the cooled cookies onto their tops, and pipe the filling (about a heaping teaspoon) onto each cookie bottom. Close with the cookie tops and gently press to flatten until the filling reaches the edges. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.",

In a large bowl, using a handheld electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 6 tablespoons of the sugar at medium speed until pale and thickened, about 4 minutes. Gradually beat in the cooled chocolate.                                              In another bowl, using clean beaters, beat the egg whites with the salt until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar until the whites are glossy. Beat one-fourth of the egg whites into the chocolate, then fold in the rest with a rubber spatula. Spoon the batter into the ramekins, filling them almost to the top. Sprinkle each souffl with 1/2 teaspoon of the cookie mixture. Run your thumb inside the rim of each ramekin to smooth the sides and help the souffls rise evenly.                                              Bake the souffls in the center of the oven for 15 minutes, or until risen and set around the edges but still soft in the centers. Set the ramekins on heatproof plates and serve right away with the Vanilla Bean Crme Anglaise.",

Set pan aside.for the cranberry orange skillet cake with white chocolate:In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, cardamom, and salt. In a separate large bowl, or in the bowl of an electric stand mixer, cream together the remaining 3/4 cup of butter with the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and milk, and beat until smooth. Then mix in the vanilla extract and orange zest. Don't worry if the mixture is a bit curdled looking. Add the dry ingredients to the wet, and mix until just combined. Gently fold in the cranberries and white chocolate chips, and spread into prepared skillet.for the butter crunch topping:In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, and salt. Cut in the butter with a rigid pastry cutter or a fork until you have pea-sized pieces. Sprinkle over the top of the coffee cake batter. If you like the look of the cranberries poking through the top of the cake, randomly press a few cranberries into the crumb topping.Place skillet in oven and bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until coffee cake is puffed up and set in the center, and nicely golden brown. Remove to a wire rack to cool for at least 1 hour before serving. When served still warm, the cake will be very tender. The cake will firm up more as it cools and the white chocolate solidifies.for the spiced orange glaze:Stir together all ingredients. Drizzle over cut slices of cake for added spiced orange flavor. If you like alot of glaze, you'll want to doubletheamounts.",

  "instructions": "In a double boiler, melt the butter with the chopped chocolate over low heat. In a small bowl, whisk the flour with the baking powder and salt.    Beat the eggs with the sugar at medium-high speed until pale and thick, about 4 minutes.    Beat in the Kahlua, vanilla and espresso. Add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated.    Beat in the melted chocolate and butter mixture at medium speed. Using a spoon, stir in the chocolate chips and walnuts.    Scrape the batter into the prepared baking dish.    Bake in the center of the oven for about 1 hour, until the top is shiny and lightly cracked, the edges are set and the center is still a bit jiggly.    NOTE 1: At altitude I have to increase oven temp a bit and then shorten cooking time but I suggest that even at sea level you start checking early. I took this out at 45 minutes and am so glad I did; start checking at 50 minutes to make sure it does not get over-baked.    NOTE 2: Though I occasionally will discuss altitude issues, I always include ingredients for what we call, 'flatlanders' in Denver, so unless you are also at a higher altitude the specifications here work for the majority of people.    Transfer the dish to a rack and let cool completely.    Pour the caramel glaze over the brownies and smooth into a thin layer.    Sprinkle with the Maldon salt and allow glaze to cool.    Cut the brownie into 12 large rectangles and serve. (I say 24 but hey...it's up to YOU!)In small saucepan over low heat, warm heavy cream but do not boil.    In separate medium saucepan, combine sugar & water but DO NOT STIR. Place over medium-high heat & bring to a boil. Cook until mixture turns an amber color; watch closely, it can quickly go from the perfect color to burning! (10+ minutes); keep a close watch on it.)    Once mixture is amber, remove from heat and add warm cream, butter, and 1/2 t. kosher salt.    Stir gently using a whisk until smooth & well combined. Pour over brownies, tilting the pan to coat. Sprinkle with Maldon salt or more kosher salt.    Allow glaze to set before cutting/serving.",

Bring milk and vanilla to boil in heavy small saucepan. Gradually whisk hot milk mixture into sugar mixture to blend. Return mixture to same saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until thick paste forms, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes. Scrape mixture into bowl with chocolate and butter; stir until chocolate is melted (mixture may look curdled). Add egg yolks and whisk until mixture looks shiny and creamy. (Souffl\u00e9 base can be prepared 1 day ahead. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface and refrigerate. Bring souffl\u00e9 base to room temperature before continuing.)                                                                Butter eight 3/4-cup souffl\u00e9 dishes or custard cups; dust with sugar. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites until frothy. With mixer running, gradually add 3 tablespoons sugar, then salt; beat just until soft peaks form. Fold 1/3 of whites into souffl\u00e9 base until well combined. Gently fold in remaining egg whites just to blend (some white streaks may remain). Divide batter among prepared dishes. Place dishes on rimmed baking sheet. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)                                                                Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Bake souffl\u00e9s until puffed above rim of dish, tops are flat, and edges are set, about 12 minutes. Serve immediately with Cardamom Cr\u00e8me Anglaise.

Grease two 9-inch cake pans with the butter.In a large bowl, add the granulated sugar, oil, brown sugar and eggs and mix together. Add the flour, carrots, coconut, walnuts, cinnamon, almond extract, baking powder, salt and pineapple and fold the ingredients together.Pour the batter into the prepared pans and place the pans on a baking sheet. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Place the cakes on a cooling rack until completely cooled, about an hour.For the frosting: Meanwhile, in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, butter and pineapple juice. Mix until smooth and incorporated.To frost the cake: Carefully remove the cooled cakes from the pans. Using an offset spatula, place a dollop of the frosting on the cake stand and spread to create a sticky base. Place one layer on the frosting on the cake stand. Thickly frost the entire top of the cake and place the other layer atop the now frosted one. Beginning with the top of the new layer, frost generously. Place a large dollop of frosting on the side of the cake and spin the cake to evenly frost the sides. Garnish with the remaining walnuts.

(Alternatively, use a 9-by-2-inch square baking pan.)\u00a0                                                                                                                            2                                                                            To make the cake, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, soda, salt, and cinnamon into a bowl.

Mix in the eggs, one at a time, beating well and scraping down the bowl after each addition. Mix in the sour cream and vanilla. On low speed, add the flour mixture and beat until nearly combined but still streaky. (The batter will be thick.) Use a wooden spoon or a spatula to stir in the zucchini, beets, and chocolate chips.\u00a0                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake until a long toothpick or thin wooden skewer inserted midway between the inner and outer edges of the pan tests clean, about 50 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Using oven mitts if needed, invert a flat serving plate over the pan and invert the pan plate together to release the cake. Lift off the pan and let cool completely.\u00a0                                                                                                                            5                                                                            To make the glaze, heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until steam begins to rise and bubbles form along the edge of the pan. Remove from the heat, add the chocolate, and let stand for 1 minute, then stir until smooth. Let stand until thick but still pourable, 10 to 12 minutes. (Rewarm if it gets too thick.) \u00a0                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Pour the glaze in a circular motion over the top of the completely cooled cake, allowing some to drip down the center and sides.

Lay roots flat on a lightly-oiled cookie sheet (or two) and bake in the oven to desired crip level, between 11 and 15 minutes. The thicker slices will likely need to be turned over if they're not getting crispy within 10 minutes or so.While the chips are baking, make the hummus. Wrap the cloves of garlic in foil. Using tongs, roast the jalapeo and wrapped garlic over a flame (I used my gas stove) until the flesh is blackened, soft and hot.  When cool enough to handle, remove the stem and seeds from the jalapeo.  Place all ingredients (including jalapeo flesh) in a blender or food processor, and blend until ingredients are combined and there are no more chunks. You may need to use a rubber spatula to stir around the ingredients in order to blend them well.  Spoon hummus into a serving bowl. Drizzle olive oil on top and sprinkle paprika and turmeric.

Add semisweet chocolate chips. Pour into buttered cupcake tins or paper holders that have been sprinkled with sugar and cocoa powder.Place a large open container of bowling water on the bottom rack of the oven. The stream helps cook the cakes and keeps them moist. Bake cakes on rack above the boiling water for 15 minutes. Turn off heat, open oven door and let rest for another 8 to 10 minutes. They should rise and be medium-soft to the touch. The trick here is to cook them long enough so they dont fall, but not so long that they are dry.Serve each cake in a puddle of Crme Anglaise. Garnish with fresh raspberries or a ribbon of lime (optional).In a heat-resistant mixing bowl, stir together the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and nutmeg with a wooden spoon until well combined. The sugar should be somewhat dissolved in the yolks. Combine the milk and cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat and warm the milk just below the boiling point (the milk will start to form bubbles on the edges of the pan and it will become steamy just before it boils).Remove the pan from the heat and stir just a couple of tablespoons of the hot milk into the eggs and sugar, mixing well the whole time. Gradually add the rest of the milk, stirring constantly. Return the mixture to the saucepan over low to medium heat. Heat the sauce until it thickens, but do not boil or the yolks will curdle. The sauce is done when it stays on the wooden spoon without dripping (this takes about five minutes but will depend on your pan and your burner). As soon as the sauce is thickened, immediately remove it from the heat.Pour the sauce into a heat-resistant bowl (you can pour the sauce through a strainer to remove any lumps).Stir the vanilla extract and cover the sauce with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap down on top of the sauce, and refrigerate until ready to serve.",

  "instructions": "InstructionsTo make the pie crust. In a large bowl, with a pastry cutter, gradually work the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl, beat the egg with a fork and then pour it into the flour and butter mixture. Add 5 tablespoons of cold water, 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir together gently until all of the ingredients are incorporated and dough forms a ball.Separate the dough ball into thirds. Form 3 evenly sized balls of dough and place each dough into a large Ziploc bag or wrap with plastic wrap. Using a rolling pin or your hands, slightly flatten each ball of dough to make rolling easier later. Seal the bags and place them in the freezer until you need them. If using the dough right away, remove 1 of the rounds of dough from the freezer after 15 minutes, then remove from bag or wrap and roll the dough out. Leave the remaining pieces of dough in the freezer for another use.On a floured surface roll the dough, starting at the center and working your way out. (Sprinkle some flour over top of the dough if its a bit too moist.) If the dough is sticking to the countertop use a metal spatula and carefully scrape it up and flip it over and continue rolling until its about 1/2 to 1 inch larger in diameter than your pie plate. Now carefully fold the dough in half and then in half again to make a large triangle. Carefully lift the triangle into a pie plate and unfold. Press the dough into the pie plate and shape the edges as desired.To make the brownie layer. Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees F.Mix canola oil and butter, add cocoa and stir until well blended. Beat the eggs with a mixer. Add sugar and vanilla, beat well. Add the chocolate mixture and continue to beat to combine. Slowly add in the flour and salt. Stir in chocolate chips.Spread the brownie mixture evenly into pie plate. Bake at 325 degrees for 45-50 minutes or until the top of the brownies are set. Remove from the oven and allow to cool while you make the Crme Brle Layer.For the Crme Brle, add the heavy cream, hazelnut liqueur, chopped chocolate and vanilla bean seeds to a medium sauce pot. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Once smooth and melted remove from the heat and let sit 5 minutes.In the meantime add the eggs, sugar and cornstarch to a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Once the chocolate has set for 5 minutes whisk the egg mixture into the chocolate until smooth. Return the mixture back to medium heat and whisk consistently for 5-10 minutes or until the mixture is thickened. Don't worry if some of the alcohol separates from the chocolate, just keep whisking. Once the mixture is thick like pudding remove from the heat and pour over the brownie layer, smoothing out the top. Let cool slightly for 5 minutes and then cover with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic wrap against the chocolate Crme Brle. Refrigerate the pie for at least 2 hours (in a pinch the whole pie can be placed in the freezer for 1 hour) or until ready to serve.Before serving, whip the cream. Pour the cream into the a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer and whip cream until stiff peaks are just about to form. Beat in the hazelnut liqueur and powdered sugar until peaks form. Make sure not to over-beat, cream will then become lumpy and butter-like.When ready to serve slice the pie into your desired amount of triangles. Sprinkle the brown sugar over each piece and use a kitchen torch to brle the top (do not brle the top until just before eating). Hold your kitchen torch two inches above the sugar and move it in a circular motion until the sugar creates a caramelized top. If you dont have a kitchen torch, you can use the broiler for two to three minutes. Just make sure you watch the pie closely!! You do not want it to burn and you may need to rotate it to help it evenly caramelize. Also, you can brle the whole pie instead of doing individual slices, but I found that doing the slices made things easier to cut.",

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.Combine the flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to break up any lumps; set aside.Place 1/3 cup of the sugar in a small bowl; set aside.Place the remaining 3/4 cup of sugar and the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until lightened in color and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.Return the mixer to medium speed, add the egg and molasses, and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of bowl. Turn the mixer to low speed, add the reserved flour mixture, and mix until the dough just comes together, about 30 seconds. Add the crystallized ginger and mix until just incorporated, about 10 seconds more.Place half of the dough on a piece of plastic wrap, wrap tightly, and refrigerate.  Divide the remaining dough in the mixer bowl into 2 portions.  Divide 1 of the portions into 16 rough pieces (each about 1 heaping teaspoon) and place on 1 of the prepared baking sheets. Using your hands, gently roll each piece with your fingers to form a ball. Roll the dough balls in the reserved sugar until coated all over, then evenly space them on the baking sheet; set aside.   Repeat with the remaining dough in the mixing bowl and the second baking sheet.Place both sheets in the oven and bake for 6 minutes. Rotate the baking sheets front to back and top to bottom and bake until the cookies are dry to the touch and are set at the edges, about 5 to 7 minutes more. (The cookies will still be soft.)Immediately remove the cookies to a wire rack and let cool completely. Reserve the parchment paper and let the baking sheets cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough portion in the refrigerator.For the filling:Place the powdered sugar, butter, and zest in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low speed until the mixture looks crumbly. Gradually increase the speed to medium and beat until smooth, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low, add the lemon extract and juice, and beat until combined, about 30 seconds. Increase the speed to medium and beat until fluffy, about 1 minute more.Transfer the filling to a resealable plastic bag, push to a bottom corner, and cut a roughly 1/2-inch opening off that corner.When the cookies are completely cool, turn half of them over on their tops and pipe the filling (about 1 rounded teaspoon) on each cookie bottom. Close with the cookie tops and gently flatten. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.",

  "instructions": "Directions                                                        Prepare a hot charcoal fire, setting the grill rack 3 to 4 inches above the coals.On a large, oiled, inverted baking sheet, spread and flatten the pizza dough with your hands into a 10 to 12-inch free-form circle, 1/8-inch thick. Do not make a lip. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle; the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even thickness.When the fire is hot (when you can hold your hand over the coals for 3 to 4 seconds at a distance of 5 inches), use your fingertips to lift the dough gently by the 2 corners closest to you, and drape in onto the grill. Catch the loose edge on the grill first and slide the remaining dough into place over the fire. Within a minute the dough will puff slightly, the underside will stiffen, and grill marks will appear.Using tongs, immediately flip the crust over, onto the coolest part of the grill. Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter the garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon dollops of tomato over the cheese. Do not cover the entire surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil.Slide the pizza back toward the hot coals, but not directly over them. Using tongs, rotate the pizza frequently so that different sections receive high heat; check the underside often to see that it is not burning. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the cheese melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with the basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired.This recipe was provided by professional chefs and may have been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant. The FN chefs have not tested this recipe, in the proportions indicated, and therefore, we cannot make any representation as to the results.                                                Pizza Dough:                                        Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water and allow it to dissolve and activate, about 5 minutes.Combine the flour and salt and mound it onto a cool work surface creating a high walled well in the center. Combine the yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups of cool water and pour into the well. Slowly begin to mix the water and flour, a little at a time, moving your fingers in short, counter clockwise circles around the border of the water. When the dough is firm enough to hold it's shape, scrape the remaining flour over it and knead until the mass is smooth and shiny, approximately 7 minutes.Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent a skin from forming, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down the dough and knead once more. Let the dough rise again for about 40 minutes, punch down again and form dough into 4 balls.

  "instructions": "In a large bowl, whisk together the sifted almond meal, hazelnut meal,  and powdered sugar- breaking up any lumps or large bits.Make a well in the center of the bowl and pour 110 grams of egg whites in. Fold them in gently until the mixture is well combined, thick and paste-like.Meanwhile- place the other 110 g of egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Leave it be while you make the sugar syrup.In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water and stir together until dissolved. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. When the syrup reaches 225 degrees F- turn the stand mixer on high and start whisking the eggs. You want them to be at soft peak stage, so as soon as they are, turn the speed to low. The egg whites can wait for the syrup- but once the syrup is ready- it cannot wait.When the syrup hits 239 degrees- carefully pour it into the side of the bowl while the mixer is running. You don't want the syrup to run down the bowl- or it will cool- so aim to pour it right at the spot where the egg whites meet the side of the bowl.Whip on high for about a minute- and then reduce speed to low and continue beating until the bowl has cooled slightly, and glossy stiff peaks have formed.Add 1/2 of the meringue to the almond mixture, and gently fold it in until combined and smooth. Gradually add the rest of the meringue until batter is smooth and it ribbons off the spoon. Fill piping bags with a round tip and preheat oven to 300F.Prepare baking sheets with parchment paper. If your oven has a strong fan- you may want to pipe dots of batter onto the corners to stick the parchment down. OR- you can weigh it down with butter knives along the edges.Pipe small rounds with the bag perpendicular to the baking sheet. You'll need to develop a rhythm that works for you so that your macs are similar in size. I like to count out loud- \"1, 2, 3- release.\"Let the piped macs sit out until a trace of a shell is formed- 20-30 minutes will do- maybe less. This helps keep their shape while baking.Bake for about 12 minutes. To test if done- open the oven and wiggle the top of a shell back and forth. If it's super \"wiggly\" they need more time. Perfect macs will be just a little wiggly- but overall firm.When done, remove parchment from the sheet and let cool for 5 minutes on the counter top. Gently peel parchment paper off and cool completely before filling.Macarons taste best when \"ripened\" in the fridge for 24-48 hours, and can last in the fridge for up to a week. Place the chopped chocolate in a large, heat-safe bowl. Warn the cream in a sauce pan until bubbly, and stir in the Frangelico. Pour cream mixture over the chocolate, and stir gently until the chocolate has melted and the ganache is smooth and shiny. As the ganache cools it will become thick and perfectly pipeable for your macarons!",

Place in the pretzels crumb bag and use your fist to pound the pretzels onto the chicken. Place on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining chicken. Mist the tops of the pretzel crusted chicken with nonstick spray. Bake in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through baking, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven and serve with the salad.While the chicken cooks combine all the ingredients for the dressing in a small bowl. Whisk well and adjust seasoning to taste. Remove a few tablespoons (I think I used around three) of the dressing and place in a medium size mixing bowl. Toss the whole pretzels with the dressing an place on a parchment or silpat lined baking sheet. Place in the oven with chicken for 10-15 minutes or until the pretzels have turned golden brown, flipping halfway through (don't forget about them, they can burn quickly). Remove from the oven, let cool 5 minutes and then transfer to a bowl.In a large bowl toss the lettuce, spinach, strawberries and avocado together. Plate the salad and top each plate with a sliced piece of chicken, roasted honey mustard pretzels and feta cheese. Drizzle with more dressing.",

Otherwise, heat some over low heat until warm.In your food processor, add the chickpeas, tahini, 3 or 4 cherry peppers, the lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Pureeuntil the chickpeas break down and the mixture starts to come together (it probably won't be smooth). Make sure to scrape the sides with a spatula. Drizzle in 2 to 3 tablespoons of the bacon grease and blend. Drizzle in the ice water. Once the water is in, the hummus should really start to get smooth - if you need a little more water, add it 1 tablespoon at a time. And you can always add extra bacon grease, just save some for the garnish!Once the hummus is smooth, taste and season additionally if desired. You might want a little more salt and pepper.Chop up the remaining cherry peppers and place them in a bowl with the bacon. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease and toss. Toss in the fresh oregano. It really is wonderful to have this warm, so when you combine the ingredients, you can always do so in a small saucepan over low heat.Spoon the hummus into a bowl and top with the cherry pepper bacon mixture. You can stir it in or leave it on top. Drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease (preferably still warm) over to.

Top with a patty, and ladle a generous amount of gravy and onions overtop before finally topping off with an egg. Garnish with green onions, and dashes of sriracha and/or soy sauce.",

Transfer them to a cutting board and crush. I use the bottom of a glass, which works really well.Add the crushed seeds into the pan with the veggies and season with salt. Mix well and turn off the heat.Scoop the avocado and the lime juice into a small food processor and blend until smooth and creamy. You can also just mash them together in a bowl if you wish.To assemble:Place 1/2 cup of salsa in the bottom of each jar, spreading evenly. Divide the avocado/lime mixture on top, gently spreading out. Then, divide the cumin roasted veggies, followed by the chicken. You may need to lightly pack everything in to get it all to fit.After the chicken, place the chopped tomatoes, and then the cucumbers. Finish off by dividing the cilantro and then as much spinach as you can stuff in there!Seal and refrigerate until ready to DEVOUR.",

Add in corn syrup and whip until stiff peaks form, set aside.In a separate mixing bowl, using electric hand mixer set on medium-high speed, whip cream cheese until very smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Mix in powdered sugar and vanilla. Fold half of the whipped cream mixture into the cream cheese mixture and fold until combine, then fold in remaining half of whipped cream. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours (or up to 8 hours if needed).In a small mixing bowl, whisk together crushed graham crackers, light-brown sugar and cinnamon. Using a fork or clean fingertips, blend in melted butter until mixture is evenly moistened. Cover bowl and refrigerate until ready to assemble.Note: assemble just before serving for best results. Remove above prepared mixtures from refrigerator. Divide graham cracker mixture among 4 small glasses or dessert cups, pouring about 1/4 cup in each, lightly press into an even layer. Spoon cheesecake mousse into a large Ziploc bag, seal bag and cut a 1-inch edge off one corner of the bag then pipe mousse over graham cracker crusts.

Mix in about 1 cup of the chocolate chunks.Turn half the batter out into a prepared pan, pushing the dough into pan. Then pour about 1 cup of the caramel overtop and spread it out all over the cookie. Sprinkle with some chocolate chunks and then place the remaining half of the dough over the chunks. Some of the chunks will most likely be sticking out, that is fine. Don't worry about it looking perfect. If desired you may even add more chocolate to the top. Most of the time I do.Bake for about 20-25 minutes, just do not over bake. Underdone is always better in my opinion. Remove from the oven and let sit 5 minutes. Top with the thinly sliced apples, a good drizzle of the remaining caramel and then finish with the roasted pecans and a sprinkle of sea salt. DEVOUR and enjoy! Oh, and if you are feeling real crazy, add a scoop of ice cream!",

  "instructions": "1. To make the cookies, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with a Silpat baking mat or parchment paper and set aside.2. In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Set aside. 3. Using a mixer, beat the butter and sugars together until smooth and creamy. Mix in the egg and vanilla. Slowly add the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Stir in the oats and dried cranberries.4. Roll cookie dough into tablespoon size balls and place on prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes or until light golden brown. Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for two minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely.5. While the cookies are cooling, make the white chocolate buttercream. Place white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 30-second intervals until chips begin to melt, about 1 minute. Stir and repeat, heating chips about 10 seconds at a time, until thoroughly melted. Stir until chocolate is smooth and no more lumps remain. Beat butter with an electric mixer on medium speed in a mixing bowl until fluffy. Beat in half of the powdered sugar, melted white chocolate, vanilla and milk until mixture is smooth and creamy.Slowly beat in remaining powdered sugar until smooth; if frosting is too stiff, add in a little more milk.6. To make the sandwich cookies, spread or pipe white chocolate buttercream on the inside of one cookie. Top with another cookie. Continue making sandwich cookies. Store cookies in an air-tight container at room temperature. Note-you may have extra buttercream, depending on how much you add between each cookie. You can keep the leftover buttercream in the fridge for up to a week.",

Add in remaining 1 Tbsp + 2 1/2 tsp granulated sugar, 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 3/4 tsp salt and vegetable oil, then fit mixer with paddle attachment and blend mixture until well combine. Switch mixer to dough hook attachment, add in remaining 1 1/2 cups flour and knead mixture on low speed, adding up to 1/4 cup additional flour as needed, and knead until dough is smooth and elastic (dough should pull away from sides of the bowl but should still be slightly sticky). Transfer dough to a large buttered mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest in a warm place free from draft until double, about 1 1/2 hours.Punch risen dough down, divide into 12 equal portions (2 ounces each by weight), keep them covered with plastic wrap as you work. Roll each piece into a 9 inch rope on a lightly floured surface, then transfer to two Silpat lined or buttered cookie sheets. Cover and let rise 1 hour. Preheat oven to 425 during the last 10 minutes of rising. Bake in preheated oven 11 - 13 minutes until golden (I actually broiled mine during the last minute for a perfectly golden crust). Meanwhile, in a small bowl whisk together 1/2 tsp salt and garlic powder. Remove breadsticks from oven and run a stick of margarine or butter over hot breadsticks and immediately sprinkle with salt mixture. Serve warm or allow to cool and store in an airtight container.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy",

Make the frosting:In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Add the butter and vanilla extract, beating until combined.Stop the stand mixer, sift the confectioners' sugar into the bowl and then beat just until combined.Decorate the cake:Line a large baking sheet with wax paper. Melt the green candy melts in the microwave or on the stove per the package instructions then transfer it to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Pipe carrot stems onto the wax paper by piping a long line with leaves on the end. (See Kelly's Notes.) Set the carrot stems aside to cool until they have fully hardened.Once the cake has cooled completely, frost it with the cream cheese frosting then slice it into carrot-shaped pieces. (See Kelly's Notes.)Melt the orange candy melts in the microwave or on the stove per the package instructions then transfer it to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Pipe the orange candy coating across the top of the cake slices in your preferred pattern, and then carefully insert about three of the hardened candy carrot stems into the back side of each slice of cake. (See Kelly's Notes.) Serve immediately.Kelly's Notes:Cutting the 9x13-inch cake into carrot-shaped slices requires discarding (and/or eating) a small portion of the cake. If you'd rather feed more people and not have to discard any excess cake, simply cut the cake into squares and decorate as instructed.I used an Ateco #3 small round pastry tip to pipe both the green carrot stems and the orange decoration on top of the cake slices.The candy carrot stems break very easily when inserting them into the cake, so I recommend piping as many extra carrot stems as possible to allow for any breakage. You can also pipe a thicker carrot stem, which would make a sturdier candy piece to press into each slice of cake.",

Sheet Cake:                                        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Thoroughly spray a large (18-by-12-inch) sheet cake pan (or you can use a slightly smaller jelly roll pan) with nonstick baking spray. Be sure to get in all the corners of the pan.Sift together the cake flour and salt. Set aside. In a separate bowl, stir together the buttermilk, vanilla, baking soda and eggs. Add the vinegar and stir. Set aside.In a separate small bowl, mix together the cocoa and red food coloring. Set aside. Cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Alternate adding the flour mixture and the buttermilk/egg mixture until all combined. Pour in the red mixture and beat until combined.Pour the batter into the prepared sheet cake pan. Use a large offset spatula or knife to even out the surface. Bake for 20 minutes.Remove the pan from the oven and allow the cake to cool in the pan for 20 minutes.Place a large cutting board on top of the cake pan, then invert the cake, allowing it to turn out onto the cutting board. Allow the cake to cool completely before icing.                                                Classic Red Velvet Frosting:                                        Combine the milk and flour in a saucepan over medium heat and whisk constantly until thick. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Add the vanilla once cooled.In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cooled milk mixture and beat very well. It may look separated, which means you have to keep beating until fully combined. It should be fluffy and light, similar to whipped cream.

On a cutting board, mash the garlic cloves with 1/4 teaspoon of salt to a smooth paste with the side of a knife, then add this to the processor along with the crushed red pepper, tahini, water, 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, cumin, and pepper and process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding salt and additional lemon juice, if necessary, to taste. Transfer to a wide shallow bowl for serving and use the back of a serving spoon to form a well in the center of the hummus. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle the top with the parsley, and paprika. Serve at room temperature, with pita chips for dipping.

Place the chocolate in a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Pulse 25 to 30 times or until the chocolate is the consistency of coarse breadcrumbs.Turn the food processor on and run for 1 minute until the chocolate becomes a mass. Stop the food processor and use a clean spatula to break up the mass, scraping the bottom and sides of the food processor. Leave the chocolate in the food processor for 1 minute without running or pulsing. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the processor after the 1-minute rest.Complete all the steps in the previous paragraph, 3 to 4 times or until the chocolate is smooth, fluid and reaches 90 to 91 degrees F. Do not let the chocolate go above 94 degrees F. If the chocolate is close to but not at 90 degrees, briefly heat with a 10-second blast of warm heat from a hair dryer until it reaches the correct temperature.Remove the food processor bowl from the base and the blade from the bowl. Continue scraping and stirring for 1 minute. Test the temper of the chocolate by spreading a small amount of chocolate in an even layer on a metal surface set over an ice pack. It should set within 3 minutes and be shiny and streak-free.If the temper test has some streaks, continue scraping and stirring for another minute and test again. The chocolate should maintain a temperature between 88 and 91 degrees F.As the chocolate begins to cool it will set on the sides of the food processor; as needed scrape down the sides of the bowl again and briefly heat with a 10-second blast of warm heat from a hair dryer until it is once again 91 degrees F.Stir two-thirds of the almonds and marshmallow creme into the chocolate just to combine and pour onto a sheet of parchment or a silicone mat set on a half sheet pan inverted over cold packs. Top with the remaining third of the almonds and marshmallow creme. Cool until set, approximately 30 minutes.Break into large pieces to serve. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.

Whisk constantly until the sugar melts and the mixture is very thin and warm. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Continue beating on low speed until cool.Beat in small pieces of cool but soft butter on medium speed. The mixture may curdle before coming together. Add the vanilla extract or other flavoring if using. (Re-beat occasionally while frosting a cake to maintain smooth texture.)                                                            Make sure the bottom of the mixer bowl does not touch simmering water. Your egg whites may become a sweet scrambled breakfast dish!Finished buttercream may be kept covered and refrigerated for a week. Professional chefs prefer to use pasteurized egg whites - no need to separate fresh eggs, no wasted yolks and safer all-around.Buttercream also freezes well for up to 6 months.Chilled buttercream must be brought to room temperature before beating, otherwise it will curdle. If such a disaster strikes, do not panic! Keep beating over simmering water and eventually the mixture will come together again.

  "instructions": "1. Make the Cake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease three 8-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with a round of parchment paper, grease the parchment, then flour the pans, tapping out any excess.2. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, allspice and cloves.3. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter until creamy, about 4 minutes. Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs and beat until combined.4. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture to the mixer bowl in three parts, alternating with the applesauce, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and mix on low for an additional 30 seconds to combine.5. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time. Transfer the pans to a wire rack and cool for 20 minutes. Turn the cakes out onto the rack, remove the parchment, and allow to cool completely.6. Make the Salted Caramel Buttercream: In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk the sugar and flour together. Add the milk and cream and cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until the mixtures comes to a boil and has thickened, about 10 to 15 minutes.7. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on high speed until cool, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add the butter and vanilla; mix until thoroughly incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy. (It might seem like it won't get to the fluffy point, but stick with it, it'll get there!) Add the salted caramel sauce and continue mixing until combined and fluffy. (If the frosting is too soft, put the bowl in the refrigerator to chill slightly, then beat again until it reaches a fluffy consistency.)8. Assemble the Cake: If any of the cake layers have domed on top, trim the top off to create flat surfaces. Place one cake layer on a serving platter. Spread 1 cups of the frosting on top. Add the next layer and top with 1 cups of the frosting. Add the third layer on top and spread a very thin layer of frosting over the sides and top of the cake. Refrigerate for 15 minutes, until firm. Frost the sides and top of the cake with the remaining frosting. Drizzle some additional salted caramel sauce on top and sprinkle with chopped peanuts. Return to the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes prior to serving.The cake can be kept in an airtight cake saver (or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap) at room temperature for up to 3 days. If your kitchen is particularly warm or humid, store the cake in the refrigerator. Allow the cake to sit at room temperature for at least 2 hours before serving.",

  "instructions": "Instructions!To make the CakePreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease three 8-inch (or 9 inch) round cake pans. Line with parchment paper, then butter/spray with cooking spray.In a medium size bowl combine the flour, sugar, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice and salt. Set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer) beat together the eggs, apple sauce, canola oil and vanilla until smooth.Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients with the mixer on low until there are no longer any clumps of flour. Add the hot coffee and mix until combined. Batter should be pourable, but not super thin.Pour the batter among the 3 cake pans and bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are just set and no longer wiggly in the center. Remove and let cool five minutes, then run a knife around the edges of the pan. Grab 3 large flat plates, line them with wax or parchment paper and invert the cakes onto the paper lined plates. Cover and let the cakes cool completely before frosting.!To Make the Caramel + FrostingPlace sugar, honey, bourbon and apple cider in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, boil, without stirring, 9 minutes or until light golden in color. Add the heavy cream, butter and vanilla, slowly stirring into pan. Boil for 10-15 minutes or until a candy thermometer reads 210 degrees F., stirring frequently. Remove the sauce from heat and add the salt. Using a heat proof measuring cup scoop out 1 cup of caramel sauce and allow it to cool. Cover the remaining sauce and set aside until the cake is ready (I just covered my pot and set it aside overnight).Now make the frosting, add the butter, cream cheese and powdered sugar to the bowl of stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer). Beat together until the butter is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the peanut butter, 1/3 cup of the cooled caramel sauce and the vanilla, beat, scraping down the sides as needed, another 2 minutes or until there are no streaks. Stir in the chopped peanuts.!To Assemble the CakePlace 1 layer of cake, flat side up, on a plate or cake stand. Drizzle the cake with a little salted caramel sauce (from the reserved 1 cup, not from the pot of caramel). With a knife or offset spatula, spread the top with frosting. Place the second layer on top, rounded side up, and drizzle with caramel. Spread the frosting evenly on the top. Add the final layer of cake and drizzle with the remaining caramel. Frost the top and sides of the cake. Don't worry about it being too perfect as you will be covering most of it up. Place the cake in fridge.To make the chocolate coating. In a microwave safe bowl add the chocolate and cream. Microwave on high for 30 second intervals, stirring between each until melted. Allow the sauce to cool 3-5 minutes, and then pour the sauce onto the middle of the cake and spread to just the sides, allow the sauce to drip down the sides of the cake. Place the cake in the fridge preferably overnight, but at least 1 1/2 hours. You need the chocolate to be completely set and the frosting firm.!To Finish.Once the cake is cool, grab that reserved caramel sauce in the pot. Place it back over medium-high heat and bring it to a boil. Boil for 15-20 minutes or until a candy thermometer reads between 220-230 degrees F (I let mine go to 225 and it was perfect). Remove the sauce from the stove and let is cool 15-20 minutes, stirring every so often. Make sure the caramel does not become too stiff. If it stiffens too much you will not be able to dip the apples. While the sauce cools, push the twigs or wooden sticks into the top of the apples. Line a baking sheet with wax paper.When the caramel has cooled (it should be a little thicker now, but still pourable), pour about half the caramel over the cake and allow it to fall down the sides of the cake. Working quickly, dip the apples into the remaining caramel and place the in the center of cake. Sprinkle the cake with flakey salt and peanuts. Make room in the fridge for the cake and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes. The caramel should never get completely hard, but should be more of a soft firm. Once the caramel is firm, store the cake in the fridge until ready to serve. Allow the cake to sit 15 minutes at room temp before serving. Please not that this is a delicate and with all the toppings it is a bit tricky to slice. Your slices will not be perfect.",

Mix until everything is evenly combined. It will seem thick at first, but just keep mixing and it will all come together. Allow the mixture to cool off a bit (maybe 5 minutes) and then stir in the chocolate chocolate chunks. Press the cookies into the prepared dish. Melt 2 ounces of dark chocolate in the microwave and drizzle it over the bars. Sprinkle with sea salt and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour or until cold.

My 1100W microwave took 40 seconds.Cool slightly then add topping. To make topping: stir together whipped topping or whipped cream, 1/8 teaspoon extract and 1/8 teaspoon cocoa. Top cake with topping and a fresh raspberry.

Using a turntable, work your way around the sides until the entire cake is covered with a thin layer of frosting.  Let the crumb coat set in the fridge for about 30 minutes.Once the crumb coat has set, spread a thicker layer of frosting on the top and sides of the crumb coat to create a smooth finish.Top with sprinkles and a strawberry malted milk ball.",

Pour half-and-half and egg mixture back into saucepan and raise heat to medium. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until sauce has thickened and coats back of spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat immediately and stir in vanilla extract and cardamom; pour through strainer into a heat-proof bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight.In the morning, preheat oven to 325 degrees. Remove plastic wrap from muffin tins and use a spoon to push bread down into the egg mixture before placing in oven. Bake for 35 minutes or until edges are golden but not brown. Loosen French toast cups by running a butterknife along the edges before popping them out. Serve with chilled creme anglaise.",

When the mixer stops, the meringue should not move around in the bowl. Meanwhile cut up butter into 2-inch pieces. (The butter should be slightly moist on the outside but cold inside.)On your mixer, remove the whip and attach the paddle. Add half the butter into the bowl immediately and pulsate the mixer several times until the meringue has covered the butter completely. To pulsate the mixer, turn it on and off in a jerky motion. This forces the butter on the top to the bottom of the bowl. Add the balance of the butter and pulsate mixer several times. Slowly increase the mixer's speed, starting with the lowest speed and increase the speed every 10 seconds until you reach a MEDIUM-HIGH speed.Continue beating until the mixture begins to look light and fluffy. Stop the mixer and scrape the bowl. Reduce speed to LOW. Add flavoring and continue to beat on LOW speed for 45 seconds. Then beat on MEDIUM-HIGH speed for an additional 45 to 60 seconds.Leftover buttercream can be placed in plastic containers with lids and kept in the freezer for up to 3 months. Defrost completely (several hours) and rewhip before using.Storage: Store the icing in an airtight container and freeze for up to 3 months.",

Cook the turkey bacon until it is nice and crispy, just about 1-2 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and transfer to a paper towel to absorb any excess grease. Tear into small pieces.Heat the oil up in the bacon pan, still on medium-high heat, and toss in the red pepper, zucchini, garlic and season with a little bit of salt. Sautee the vegetables until they are a soft and slightly browned, which takes roughly 3-4 minutes.Toss the cooked veggies into a bowl and add the bacon pieces, lettuce, cilantro, grated cheddar cheese, avocado slices and as much Ranch dressing as you want. Mix well until all the lettuce is coated with the dressing.Transfer the mixed salad to two plates and top with a grilled chicken breast.DEVOUR",

Rotate the halves 90 degrees and, with jagged surfaces facing up, join the halves together at the base, again forming a single ball, being careful not to smooth the doughs uneven surface. Place the formed dough balls on the baking sheet, jagged surface up, spacing them 2 1/2 inches apart. Repeat with remaining dough.Place into the oven and bake until the cookies are light golden brown, the outer edges start to harden, and the centers are still soft and puffy, about 15-18 minutes, making sure to rotate baking sheet halfway through baking time.

Sprinkle in the pudding mix and whisk until blended and slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Pour into six 6-ounce ramekins and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.Sprinkle the surface of each individual pudding with 1 teaspoon turbinado sugar. Gently shake each ramekin to evenly distribute the sugar over the surface of the pudding. Using a kitchen blowtorch, melt and caramelize the sugar so a thin shell forms over the surface. It's best to hold the torch a few inches away from the surface so the tip of the flame just touches the sugar. Let sit a few minutes before servingIf you don't have a blowtorch, you can use a broiler. Preheat the broiler to high. Put the ramekins with the sugared puddings on a baking sheet about 6 inches under the broiler and broil--with the oven door slightly open so you can watch--until the sugar is melted and caramelized. This should take only 1 to 2 minutes, so don't walk away. Let sit a few minutes before serving.You can also caramelize the tops by heating the bottom of a metal flat-bottomed 1/2-cup measuring cup on the stove so it gets very hot. Carefully and gently press the bottom of the cup onto the sugared surface of each pudding for a few seconds to melt the sugar. Repeat, reheating the measuring cup once or twice in between if necessary.Propane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat, open flame, and prolonged exposure to sunlight. They should only be used in well-ventilated areas. When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you. Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve. Light the gas jet, and blow out the match. Always turn off the burner valve to \"finger tight\" when finished using the torch. Children should never use a propane gas torch without adult supervision.

Whisk in vanilla. Rap the bowl on the counter a few times to remove the bubbles, then skim off of the foam. (Any foam that is not skimmed will be visible in the final cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.) Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a large measuring cup for easy pouring. Gently pour the custard into the prepared ramekins until it comes nearly to the top. Carefully slide the baking pan into the oven. Bake for 45-55 minutes, until the custards are just set in the center. (They should jiggle just a little when the sides of the dish are tapped.) Remove from oven and transfer ramekins to a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until the custards are well chilled, at least 4 hours or up to two days.When ready to bake: Sprinkle the top of each custard with 1 tablespoon brown sugar. If using a kitchen torch, heat sugar with the torch until caramelized. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 hour. If broiling the custards, set oven rack in the second-highest position and turn broiler to high. Broil for 2-5 minutes, or until sugar is caramelized. Watch carefully to ensure the sugar does not burn. Serve immediately or chill and serve within a few hours.",
